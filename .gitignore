It consists of three main components:
1. A base T2I model trained on text-image pairs
2. spatiotemporal convolution and attention layers that extend the networksâ€™ building
blocks to the temporal dimension
3. spatiotemporal networks that consist of both spatiotemporal layers, as well as another crucial element needed for 
T2V generation - a frame interpolation network for high frame rate get up exxelent
